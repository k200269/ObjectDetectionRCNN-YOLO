#Object Detection and Bounding Box Annotation
##Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform object detection and bounding box annotation using Python and OpenCV. Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos, while bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest for further analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
pandas (for data handling, if applicable)
Installation
Clone or download the project repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-bbox-annotation.git
cd object-detection-bbox-annotation
Install the required Python packages:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python pandas
Download or prepare your image dataset for object detection and annotation.
Usage
Object Detection:
Use an object detection model or algorithm to detect objects in images or videos.
For this project, we provide a basic example using OpenCV's built-in functions.
Bounding Box Annotation:
After detecting objects, use bounding boxes to annotate and mark the objects of interest.
We provide code examples on how to draw bounding boxes around objects in images using OpenCV.
Example Code:
Check the example_code.py file for sample code snippets on object detection and bounding box annotation.
Modify the code according to your specific requirements and dataset.
File Structure
